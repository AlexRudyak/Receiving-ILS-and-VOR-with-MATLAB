# Receiving-ILS-and-VOR-with-MATLAB
I'm trying to receive ILS (Instrument Landing System) signals using RTL-SDR and MATLAB - I've simulated the signals in matlab, but right now it's on hold
As I move to work on VOR, and see if I can properly receive it.

Full discloser, I have no idea how to work with all these licenses and legal stuff, so if you DO use some of my code, a referance would be awesome ! :D
