\begin{equation}
\label{Base tone equation fm}
X_{m}(t) = A_m \cos (2\pi f_m t + \phi_m)
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Carrier equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
\label{Carrier equation fm}
X_{c}(t) = A_c \cos (2\pi f_c t + \phi_c)
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{FM modulation equations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
\label{FM modulation equation}
X_{FM}(t) = A_c\cos(2\pi f_c t + 2\pi f_\Delta\\ \int_{0}^{t} X_m(t) )
\end{equation}

For a single tone modulation
\begin{equation}
\label{integral}
\int_{0}^{t} X_m(t) = \int_{0}^{t} A_m \cos (2\pi f_m t) = \frac{A_m}{2 \pi f_m} \sin(2 \pi f_m t)
\end{equation}

Using equation \eqref{FM modulation equation} and \eqref{integral}:
\begin{equation}
\label{final_fm_equation}
X_{FM}(t) = A_c\cos(2\pi f_c t + \frac{f_\Delta}{f_m}A_m \sin(2 \pi f_m t))
\end{equation}

\subsection{VOR Transmit}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
For simplicity purposes station identifier and Morse is not implemented for now. 
The VOR signal can be expressed as a sum of signals:

\begin{equation}
\label{VOR signal}
X_{VOR}(t) = A_c \cos (2 \pi f_c t)(1 + c(t) + g(t))
\end{equation}

Where:

\begin{equation}\label{c(t)}
c(t) = m_{sub} \cos (2 \pi \int_{0}^{t}\left(f_{sub} + f_\Delta \cos(2 \pi f_m t + \phi_{REF})\right)dt) 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{g(t)}
g(t) = m_{ar} \cos (2 \pi f_m t + \phi_{VAR})
\end{equation} %antenna rotation
\\
The final result, direction relation to North is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
\label{phase compare}
\phi_{Direction} = \phi_{REF}-\phi_{VAR}
\end{equation}

\section{VOR Receive}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To receive VOR signals, we first need to AM demodulate the signal, and then FM demodulate it.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{AM Demodulation}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Common techniques for AM demodulation are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Product Detector
    \item Envelope Detector
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Product Detector}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The simplest form of AM demodulation, and the chosen method. The technique simply multiplies the incoming AM signal with a local oscillator having the same frequency and phase.
\begin{equation}
\label{demodulator section AM modulation equation}
X_{AM}(t) = [1 + m\cos(2\pi f_m t + \phi_m)]A_c\cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi_c)
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{FM Demodulation}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Common techniques for FM demodulation are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Slope Detector
    \item Ratio Detector
    \item Quadrature Detector
    \item Phase-locked loop as a detector
\end{itemize}
